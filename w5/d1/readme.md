# Week 5 Day 1

In Week 5, we're continuing to look at the [_my-first-api_](../../w4/my-first-api/) example.

Today, we extended it to use `.populate()`
and to allow users to send more user-readable data (like names) than only ids when creating link records.

We also talked about **link models** in general,
and created our own **middleware** to understand more about how express works.
